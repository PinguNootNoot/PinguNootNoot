- ðŸ‘€ Hi~! Iâ€™m @PinguNootNoot, or you can call me Lincoln. I love watching movies and playing computer games. The latter is part of the reasons that I decided to learn & study programming language.
- ðŸŒ± I'm a bachelor of Computer Science from National Tsing Hua University. Here is my Github, and every piece of my works(well, most of them) is uploaded to here and categroized. Feel free to browse & view them at will.
- ðŸ“« You can contact me via MP5K1234@gmail.com
